    "These pages are called Jupyter notebooks. They allow one to run snippets of code in a web environment without any setup, downloads, or configuration. This dramatically reduces the learning curve for getting up and running on the first day. Just click the button up at the <i class=\"fas fa-rocket\"></i> button at the top and click the \"Binder\" link. It will open up an environment where you can run the code in these snippets as well as make edits and run your own code. More on this will be explained as we go along. \n",

    "You may or may not know it, but you have been taught some concepts about how to think like a programmer all your life. The first step to writing code is to understand what is is you are going to do, that is what are you going to \"compute.\" Like science and engineering problems, first the ideas must be understood, then described in equations. Only then can the \"answers\" be acquired. \n",

    "Below is an example of using booleans to control flow, using the operations we have discussed above. We will test check against known names and email addresses and say if they are in \"our contacts.\" What this shows is that you can do the same kind of thing two different ways with booleans. The first way in both cases is better, but the second can help you better understand what ```&&``` and ```||``` do. "
