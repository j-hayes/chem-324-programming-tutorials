    "\n",
    "One of the most common type of IO is reading and writing to a file. There are many formats that we can store data on a file. Some common human readable formats: \n",
    "\n",

    "### Writing to Plain Text\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to create an object called an IOStream that points to the file we want to write to. Julia provides us the function open() to do this. The function takes two arguments: \n",
    "- The path of the file\n",
    "- a character code signifying what we are going to do with the file\n",
    "  - r\t\n",
    "    - read\n",
    "  - w\t\n",
    "    - write and overwrite exiting data in the file (truncate)\n",
    "  - a\t\n",
    "    - write and append to the end\n",
    "  - r+\n",
    "    - read, write\t\n",
    "  - w+\t\n",
    "    - read, write, create (a file that doesn't exist yet), truncate\ttruncate\n",
    "  - a+\t\n",
    "    - read, write, create, append\n",
    "\n",
    "Next to write to the file we use the function write(). The first argument passed to write is our IOStream, the second is the text we want to write. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally you must close the IOStream (Otherwise other processes on the computer won't be able to use it, i.e. you won't be able to open it). "

    "- A written problem description of what the code does and how it fulfils the requirements (1-2 paragraphs)\n",
    "- Can take in multiple inputs and give correct different outputs\n",
    "- Do some sort of math\n",
    "- Multiple Functions (use guidance in previous modules on separation of concerns)\n",

    "Some suggestions for inspiration: \n",
    "- Find a text book problem and create something that can solve any problem of the same type with any input\n",
    "- Create a Tick-Tac-Toe / Rock Paper Scissors game to play against the computer and keep track of scores over time\n",

    "Use your imagination, it can be as creative (or as trivial) as you like. I just want you to get some experience starting from just an idea and turning it into code. This exercise is likely to be the most challenging one of the whole course and may take more time than the others. If you need help, please reach out! \n",
