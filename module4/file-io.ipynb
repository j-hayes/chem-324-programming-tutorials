    "- The path of the file\n",
    "- a character code signifying what we are going to do with the file\n",
    "  - r\t\n",

    "  - a+\t\n",
    "    - read, write, create, append\n",
    "\n",
    "Next to write to the file we use the function write(). The first argument passed to write is our IOStream, the second is the text we want to write. \n",
