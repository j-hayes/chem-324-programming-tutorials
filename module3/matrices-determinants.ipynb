    "I would categorize two main types of writing code: scripting and everything else (I say it this way because the other word used is usually programming, and scripting is a type of programming so, yeah there isn't a good word). I will call everything else code base development (development for short). These two concepts are not mutually exclusive, they are two sides of a coin or ends of a spectrum.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\"Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects\", which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods).\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The construct to define the data and code are called classes. These constructs are how we model the real world concepts in code.\n",
