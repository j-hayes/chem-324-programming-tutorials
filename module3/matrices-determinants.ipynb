    "I would categorize two main types of writing code: scripting and everything else (I say it this way because the other word used is usually programming, and scripting is a type of programming so, yeah there isn't a good word). I will call everything else code base development (development for short). These two concepts are not mutually exclusive, they are two sides of a coin or ends of a spectrum.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\"Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects\", which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods).\"\n",
