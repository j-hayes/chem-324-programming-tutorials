    "### What are these pages and how do they work. \n",
    "\n",
    "These pages are called Jupyter notebooks. They allow one to run snippets of code in a web environment without any setup, downloads, or configuration. This dramatically reduces the learning curve for getting up and running on the first day. Just click the button up at the <i class=\"fas fa-rocket\"></i> button at the top and click the \"Binder\" link. It will open up an environment where you can run the code in these snippets as well as make edits and run your own code. More on this will be explained as we go along. \n",
    "\n",
    "### What we are and are not going to do in these tutorials:\n",
    "**We will** \n",
    "- learn how to think about problems like a programmer \n",
    "- learn how to learn like a programmer \n",
    "- learn to write programs \n",
    "- learn about the fundamentals of writing \"good\" code, good programming habits, and the principles of software-engineering.\n",
    "- learn how to do basic troubleshooting / debugging \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**We won't**\n",
    "- talk about how computers work unless absolutely necessary \n",
    "- \"master\" the skill of programming\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Computational thinking: [1](https://ctpdonline.org/computational-thinking/)\n",
    "You may or may not know it, but you have been taught some concepts about how to think like a programmer all your life. The first step to writing code is to understand what is is you are going to do, that is what are you going to \"compute.\" Like science and engineering problems, first the ideas must be understood, then described in equations. Only then can the \"answers\" be acquired. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using computational thinking one has the tools required to synthesize problems and arrive at their solutions. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Decomposition\n",
    "\n",
    "breaking down a complex problem or system into smaller, more manageable parts\n",
    "- \"Don't solve the whole problem at once.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pattern recognition\n",
    "\n",
    "looking for similarities among and within problems\n",
    "- \"Have I done something similar before?\"\n",
    "- \"Don't reinvent the wheel\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Abstraction\n",
    "\n",
    "focusing on the important information only, ignoring irrelevant detail\n",
    "- \"Synthesize the real world concept into the necessary infromation for solving the problem\"\n",
    "- \"Model the real system, concept, etc. with data and procedures\" \n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "developing a step-by-step solution to the problem, or the rules to follow to solve the problem\n",
    "- examples in day to day life\n",
    "  - Cooking Recipes\n",
    "  - Directions from your house to the grocery store\n",
    "  - Sorting Papers in alphabetical order\n",
    "  - Performing mathematical operations using PEMDAS.\n",
    "\n",
    "Algorithms are the steps to the solution of a problem. In programming we write code to \"implement\" these algorithms, so they can be \"executed\" on a computer to get a solution. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Programming Languages\n",
    "\"A programming language is any set of rules that converts [text], to various kinds of machine code output. Programming languages are one kind of computer language, and are used in computer programming to implement algorithms.\"` [2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Syntax:\n",
    "Just as a spoken language has syntax, so does a computer programming language. The rules are just as strict for communicating properly. I cannot stress this highly enough, a computer can only understand machine code (a topic for later.) But a short description for now is that a computer can, using a program called a compiler/interpreter (or other similar concepts), convert the text of a program written in a programming language into it to machine code, which are instructions that it can execute. **If any of the code does not conform to the rules of the programming language that process will fail and you will not be able to run your code.**  At the end of the module there are examples of the programs that won't work because of \"syntax errors\". \n",

A function in programming can be thought of in the same way as one thinks about a function in mathematics. It has parameters and \"returns\" an output. In mathematics it is always numbers in and numbers out. In programming we have more freedom to express other ideas through functions. \n",
